It highlighted the colorful and more “convoluted” characteristics of Japanese websites compared with the Western websites with a more minimalistic style. I found the article interesting because it tried explaining these features from Fonts & Front-End Website Development Constraints, Technological Development & Stagnation, and a couple of cultural influences. I realized that front-end web development includes creating new fonts for romanized languages. However, unlike English, Japanese language has way more glyphs because it has more writing systems and a lot of Kanji (Hanzi), so it would be a large amount of work to scratch font sizes, which leads to less choices of font sizes. This explains why Japanese web development put more efforts on content categories with text heavy images.
