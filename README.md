It highlighted the colorful and more “convoluted” characteristics of Japanese websites compared with the Western websites with a more minimalistic style. I found the article interesting because it tried explaining these features from Fonts & Front-End Website Development Constraints, Technological Development & Stagnation, and a couple of cultural influences. I realized that front-end web development includes creating new fonts for romanized languages. However, unlike English, Japanese language has way more glyphs because it has more writing systems and a lot of Kanji (Hanzi), so it would be a large amount of work to scratch font sizes, which leads to less choices of font sizes. This explains why Japanese web development put more efforts on content categories with text heavy images.

**Comment on the Article:**
What I found particulary about this article was how many glyphs there are in Japanese compared to Latin alphabet. I never though about how different letter fonts were created and how there has to be a separate design for each letter ad glyph that will be used. Just looking at the 840 glyphs that need to be designed for Latin alphabet it seems like a lot of time would be necessary to put in but that does not even compare to 7000 (minimum) that would be necessary to create a new letter font for Japanese. Additionally, I was suprised to read about how due to cultural differences Japan has been lagging in technological literacy. *- Petra*
